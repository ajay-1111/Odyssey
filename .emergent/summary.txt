**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB database) named Odyssey.
- **Backend**: Has endpoints for user authentication (JWT), AI trip generation (using GPT-4o with a fallback), and saving trips. It also includes placeholder APIs for countries. The founder's name is set to Ajay Reddy Gopu.
- **Frontend**: A basic structure exists with pages for Landing, Login/Register, Trip Planning, and Trip Results. An initial dark theme with gold accents was implemented, but the user rejected it. Some new contexts (, ) have been created but not fully integrated.
- **Integrations**: OpenAI for AI planning and Resend for email have been set up.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent was in the middle of a major overhaul requested by the user. The last concrete action was overwriting  to begin implementing a new vibrant theme, add the user's updated bio, and a feedback section. The user is still waiting for the complete set of changes.
-   Status: IN PROGRESS
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent (after all UI/UX changes are applied) and manual screenshot verification. Backend testing will be needed for new currency and customer-type logic.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Complete UI/UX Overhaul (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The user is highly dissatisfied with the current black, white, and gold theme.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
-   **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for trip planning.
-   **Email**: Resend for sending trip plans.

**key DB schema**
-   **users**: 
-   **trips**: 

**changes in tech stack**
-   User initially asked to switch from React to plain HTML/CSS but then clarified to keep React.
-   User requested a migration from **MongoDB to Azure SQL**. This is a high-impact future task that has not been started.

**All files of reference**
-   : Main FastAPI application, contains all API logic including auth, AI trip generation, and database interactions.
-   : The main landing page, currently being redesigned.
-   : The core page for user input, needs a major overhaul to support new customer flows and features.
-   : Main React component, where contexts (, , ) will be wrapped.
-   : Global styles, updated with new theme variables for the redesign.
-   : A document for the user detailing business launch steps. Needs significant expansion.
-   : The Product Requirements Document.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The entire frontend () needs to be refactored to implement the new vibrant, modern UI/UX design, including the theme toggle and responsive controls.
-    requires a complete structural change to accommodate the three different customer flows.

**key api endpoints**
-   : User registration.
-   : User login.
-   : Generates a new trip plan using AI.
-   : Sends the trip plan to the user's email.
-   : Fetches all saved trips for the logged-in user.
-   : Gets a list of popular destinations.
-   : Gets a list of countries for form inputs.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User dissatisfaction is high.** The top priority is the complete UI/UX overhaul. Do not proceed with minor backend tasks until the user is happy with the new visual design.
-   The user has a very specific and ambitious vision. The agent must address every point in the PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS checklist.
-   The user wants to be treated as the founder, Ajay Reddy Gopu. All branding must reflect this. Any Emergent branding is to be removed.
-   The request for a business guide and payment integration is serious. The  file must be treated as a key deliverable.
-   The Azure SQL migration is a future task. Focus on completing the current feature requests on the existing MongoDB stack first, unless the user reprioritizes.
-   The agent does not have the ability to push to GitHub directly. The user must perform this action through the UI. Guide the user clearly on this.
